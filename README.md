# 2048-Game
This Python-based implementation of the classic 2048 game. i worked on this project as part of my bachelor's project. This version features a user-friendly interface, smooth tile merging, and score tracking. The game uses Python's tkinter library for the GUI and follows the standard 2048 game rules.
